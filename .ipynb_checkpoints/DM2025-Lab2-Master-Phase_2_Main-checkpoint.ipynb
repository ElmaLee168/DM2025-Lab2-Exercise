    "\n",
    "The code cell below contains the primary function, `prompt_gemini`, that we will use throughout this lab to communicate with the Gemini API. It's designed to be a flexible wrapper that handles the details of sending a request and receiving a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run the exercises, here are the key things you need to understand in this setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **API Key Configuration**: The script loads your API key from a `.env` file located in the `./config/` directory. **You must create this file and add your API key** like this: `GOOGLE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'`. This is a security best practice to keep your credentials out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Global Settings**: At the top of the script, you can find and modify several important defaults:\n",
    "    *   `MODEL_NAME`: We've set this to `\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"`, but you can easily switch to other models like `\"gemini-2.5-pro\"` to experiment.\n",
    "    *   `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`: This sets the model's default behavior or persona (e.g., \"You are a helpful assistant\"). You can customize this for different tasks.\n",
    "    *   `SAFETY_SETTINGS`: For our academic exercises, these are turned off to prevent interference. In real-world applications, you would configure these carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The `prompt_gemini` function**: This is the main tool you will use. Here are its most important parameters:\n",
    "    *   `input_prompt`: The list of contents (text, images, etc.) you want to send to the model.\n",
    "    *   `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. `0.0` makes the output deterministic and less creative, while a higher value (e.g., `0.7`) makes it more varied.\n",
    "    *   `schema`: A powerful feature that allows you to specify a JSON format for the model's output. This is extremely useful for structured data extraction.\n",
    "    *   `with_tokens_info`: If set to `True`, the function will also return the number of input and output tokens used, which is helpful for monitoring your usage against the free tier limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you will call this function with different prompts and configurations to solve various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If needed, you can also check some tutorials on how a python function works: [Python Functions Tutorial](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/)"

      "Data mining is the process of **discovering patterns, insights, and knowledge from large datasets**. It's essentially about extracting valuable information that isn't immediately obvious from raw data. Think of it as sifting through a mountain of information to find hidden treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of what that means:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Concepts:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Large Datasets:** Data mining is typically applied to datasets that are too large and complex for manual analysis. This can include customer transaction records, website logs, sensor data, social media feeds, scientific observations, and much more.\n",
      "*   **Patterns and Insights:** The goal is to identify recurring trends, relationships, anomalies, and correlations within the data. These patterns can reveal underlying structures, predict future behavior, or explain past events.\n",
      "*   **Knowledge Discovery:** The ultimate aim is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge that can be used for decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How it Works (The Process):**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining is not a single technique but rather a multi-step process, often referred to as the **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)** process. While the exact steps can vary, a common framework includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Business Understanding/Problem Definition:** Clearly defining the problem you're trying to solve or the business objective you want to achieve. This guides the entire process.\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves understanding its sources, quality, format, and potential limitations.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Data Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming step. It involves cleaning, transforming, and integrating the data to make it suitable for mining. This can include:\n",
      "    *   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.\n",
      "    *   **Data Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Data Transformation:** Normalizing, aggregating, or creating new features.\n",
      "    *   **Data Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Applying various data mining algorithms and techniques to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. This involves checking if the patterns are valid, novel, understandable, and actionable.\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Integrating the discovered knowledge into business processes or systems to achieve the desired outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Data Mining Techniques:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining employs a variety of algorithms and techniques, often categorized by the type of pattern they aim to discover:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Classification:** Assigning data points to predefined categories (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined categories (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is famously used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",
      "*   **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns that occur in a sequence over time (e.g., identifying common user navigation paths on a website).\n",
      "*   **Text Mining:** Extracting information and insights from unstructured text data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is Data Mining Important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining is crucial for businesses and organizations because it enables them to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Make Better Decisions:** By understanding customer behavior, market trends, and operational efficiencies, organizations can make more informed and strategic decisions.\n",
      "*   **Improve Customer Relationships:** Personalizing marketing campaigns, predicting customer needs, and identifying at-risk customers can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
      "*   **Detect Fraud and Abuse:** Identifying suspicious patterns can help prevent financial losses and maintain security.\n",
      "*   **Optimize Operations:** Understanding bottlenecks, predicting equipment failures, and improving resource allocation can lead to greater efficiency.\n",
      "*   **Discover New Opportunities:** Identifying emerging trends and unmet needs can lead to the development of new products and services.\n",
      "*   **Gain Competitive Advantage:** Organizations that effectively leverage data mining can outperform their competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, data mining is about transforming raw data into a strategic asset that drives innovation, efficiency, and growth.**\n",

       "Data mining is the process of **discovering patterns, insights, and knowledge from large datasets**. It's essentially about extracting valuable information that isn't immediately obvious from raw data. Think of it as sifting through a mountain of information to find hidden treasures.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of what that means:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Concepts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Large Datasets:** Data mining is typically applied to datasets that are too large and complex for manual analysis. This can include customer transaction records, website logs, sensor data, social media feeds, scientific observations, and much more.\n",
       "*   **Patterns and Insights:** The goal is to identify recurring trends, relationships, anomalies, and correlations within the data. These patterns can reveal underlying structures, predict future behavior, or explain past events.\n",
       "*   **Knowledge Discovery:** The ultimate aim is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge that can be used for decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic planning.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it Works (The Process):**\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining is not a single technique but rather a multi-step process, often referred to as the **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)** process. While the exact steps can vary, a common framework includes:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Business Understanding/Problem Definition:** Clearly defining the problem you're trying to solve or the business objective you want to achieve. This guides the entire process.\n",
       "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves understanding its sources, quality, format, and potential limitations.\n",
       "3.  **Data Preparation (Data Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming step. It involves cleaning, transforming, and integrating the data to make it suitable for mining. This can include:\n",
       "    *   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.\n",
       "    *   **Data Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
       "    *   **Data Transformation:** Normalizing, aggregating, or creating new features.\n",
       "    *   **Data Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
       "4.  **Modeling:** Applying various data mining algorithms and techniques to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
       "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. This involves checking if the patterns are valid, novel, understandable, and actionable.\n",
       "6.  **Deployment:** Integrating the discovered knowledge into business processes or systems to achieve the desired outcomes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Common Data Mining Techniques:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining employs a variety of algorithms and techniques, often categorized by the type of pattern they aim to discover:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Classification:** Assigning data points to predefined categories (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
       "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined categories (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
       "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is famously used in market basket analysis.\n",
       "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
       "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",
       "*   **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns that occur in a sequence over time (e.g., identifying common user navigation paths on a website).\n",
       "*   **Text Mining:** Extracting information and insights from unstructured text data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why is Data Mining Important?**\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining is crucial for businesses and organizations because it enables them to:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Make Better Decisions:** By understanding customer behavior, market trends, and operational efficiencies, organizations can make more informed and strategic decisions.\n",
       "*   **Improve Customer Relationships:** Personalizing marketing campaigns, predicting customer needs, and identifying at-risk customers can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
       "*   **Detect Fraud and Abuse:** Identifying suspicious patterns can help prevent financial losses and maintain security.\n",
       "*   **Optimize Operations:** Understanding bottlenecks, predicting equipment failures, and improving resource allocation can lead to greater efficiency.\n",
       "*   **Discover New Opportunities:** Identifying emerging trends and unmet needs can lead to the development of new products and services.\n",
       "*   **Gain Competitive Advantage:** Organizations that effectively leverage data mining can outperform their competitors.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In essence, data mining is about transforming raw data into a strategic asset that drives innovation, efficiency, and growth.**"

      "**Lipophagy** is like a \"clean-up crew\" within these factories. It's a process where the cell breaks down and recycles its own fat droplets (called lipid droplets). Think of these fat droplets as storage containers for energy and building materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's how HBV messes with this clean-up crew:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Virus Arrives:** HBV gets into the liver cells.\n",
      "2.  **Disrupting the Order:** The virus doesn't just sit there; it starts to cause problems. One of the things it interferes with is the normal functioning of the cell's clean-up crew (lipophagy).\n",
      "3.  **The Clean-up Crew Goes Haywire:** Instead of the cell properly managing its fat droplets, the HBV virus can either:\n",
      "    *   **Make the clean-up crew *too* active:** This means the cell starts breaking down its fat droplets too much, potentially starving itself of energy and essential components.\n",
      "    *   **Make the clean-up crew *inactive*:** This means the fat droplets build up and can become toxic, causing damage to the cell.\n",
      "    *   **Direct the clean-up crew to the wrong things:** The virus might trick the clean-up crew into attacking things it shouldn't, leading to cellular damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this bad?**\n",
      "\n",
      "When the cell's fat management system (lipophagy) is disrupted by HBV, it can lead to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cell damage:** The liver cells get stressed and injured.\n",
      "*   **Inflammation:** The body's immune system reacts to the damaged cells.\n",
      "*   **Liver disease:** Over time, this damage can contribute to serious liver problems like cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** HBV hijacks the liver cell's internal recycling system for fat droplets (lipophagy), causing it to malfunction. This malfunction leads to cell damage and contributes to liver disease.\n",

      "---新的---\n",
      "Of course! Let's explain HBV-induced lipophagy using a simple analogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Simple Analogy: A Factory Hijacking\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine your liver cell is a busy **factory**.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **The Factory's Pantry (Fat Droplets):** This factory stores its extra energy and raw materials in a pantry, in the form of **fat droplets**. Normally, the factory uses this pantry sparingly, only when it needs a boost.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **The Recycling Crew (Autophagy):** The factory has an internal \"recycling crew.\" Its job is to break down old or broken machinery and recycle the parts. This process is called **autophagy** (which means \"self-eating\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **A Special Task (Lipophagy):** Sometimes, the factory manager tells the recycling crew to do a special task: break down the supplies in the pantry (the fat droplets) to get a quick burst of energy. This specific task of \"eating fat\" is called **lipophagy**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **The Hijacker (Hepatitis B Virus - HBV):** Now, the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) sneaks into the factory. The virus is a hijacker. Its only goal is to take over the factory to build thousands of copies of itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "### What HBV-Induced Lipophagy Is:\n",
      "\n",
      "When HBV gets inside, it does something clever. It hijacks the factory's communication system and sends a fake order to the recycling crew.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The fake order is: \"Start breaking down the pantry (the fat droplets) immediately!\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is **HBV-induced lipophagy**. The virus forces the cell to start eating its own fat stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Does the Virus Do This?\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus hijacks the factory's pantry for two main reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **To Get Energy:** Building thousands of new viruses is hard work and requires a lot of energy. By forcing the cell to break down its fat, the virus gets a massive and immediate supply of fuel to power its replication assembly line.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **To Get Building Materials:** The broken-down fat provides raw materials (like fatty acids) that the virus can use as building blocks to construct its own outer shell, called the \"viral envelope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### In a Nutshell:\n",
      "\n",
      "**HBV-induced lipophagy is the process where the Hepatitis B virus hijacks a liver cell's internal recycling system, forcing it to break down its own fat stores. The virus then uses the released energy and materials to build more copies of itself, helping it to survive and spread.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This hijacking is a key survival strategy for the virus, but it can damage the liver cell over time, contributing to liver disease.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
